    review: 'Design Thinking From the structure of your game project, it is clear that: You are able to organize your code (components, hooks, views, UI). You think about UX, fallbacks, performance. You use animations, 3D interactions and fallback rendering if the model is not available. You not only create things that work, but also try to make the user happy.'

    review: 'You know how to think about cross-platform adaptation Building an APK for an Android phone shows that you think not only about the web, but also about the mobile experience. Your ability to deal with file structure, public/, vite, capacitor â€“ shows technical maturity.'

    name: 'Nana Ama McBrown',
    review: 'You are looking not only for "how to do it", but also for "why and how to do it better" Questions about the quality of UI/UX design, fallback mechanisms, content presentation, game logic - show that your approach is deeper than just technical. You want not only "working code", but also a good system.'

    review: 'Learning ability and perseverance You are not afraid to delve into mistakes ([error] android platform has not been added yet) and move on. A few good questions about building, file location, structure, and optimization show that you learn quickly through practice.'
